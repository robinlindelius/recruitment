The application log will be saved to /var/log/Recruitment/recruitment.log.
The file will act as a general log for the application and includes all output 
from the server as well as relevant exceptions thrown for debugging purposes.
In addition all major events in the application will be logged for security
purposes. This includes when a new user is registered, when and who created
an application and would also include when an application is removed,
accepted or declined when implemented.
